# Dungeons-And-Dragons
Super short experimental game in the terminal, autumn 2019. First programming project I did outside of school.

The player chooses what class to play as, and goes after that on a short adventure with a couple of
right/left choices and enemy battles, while trying to get to the end boss.

The game is run in the terminal on the computer. The point with this project was to pratice C# during
my university course in C#, and maybe experiment somewhat with the functions I had come to get well accustomed to.

In the future I may try to make this game longer, and convert it to have a GUI.
